## U200 Hardware Manual

[[中文]](../../../cn/device_and_usage_manual/ANTSDR_U_Series_Module/ANTSDR_U200_Reference_Manual/AntsdrU200_Reference_Manual_cn.html)

###  Overview

Unlike the ANTSDR E series, the U series adopts a USB 3.0 interface with an instantaneous transfer rate of 5 Gbps, which easily supports the maximum bandwidth of the AD9361. Equipped with the Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A100T baseband chip, the U200 offers an ideal solution for users who are cost-sensitive yet require high performance.
